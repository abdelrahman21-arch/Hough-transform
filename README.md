The **Hough Transform** is a powerful image analysis technique used to detect geometric shapes in images. It is particularly effective for detecting lines, circles, and other regular shapes, even in the presence of noise or partial occlusion.

### Key Concepts of Hough Transform

1. **Purpose**:
   - **Line Detection**: Identify straight lines in an image.
   - **Circle Detection**: Identify circular shapes in an image.
   - **Arbitrary Shape Detection**: With modifications, it can detect other shapes based on parametric equations.

2. **How It Works**:
   The Hough Transform converts the problem of shape detection into a parameter space representation:
   - A straight line in an image is represented by the equation \(y = mx + c\) (slope-intercept form). However, this is unsuitable when dealing with vertical lines where the slope \(m\) is undefined.
   - Instead, the **polar form** of the line equation is used:
     \[
     \rho = x \cos\theta + y \sin\theta
     \]
     where:
     - \(\rho\): Perpendicular distance from the origin to the line.
     - \(\theta\): Angle of the line's perpendicular to the x-axis.
   - In the **Hough space** (parameter space), a point in the image corresponds to a sinusoidal curve, and intersections of these curves indicate potential lines.

3. **Steps for Line Detection**:
   - **Edge Detection**: Apply an edge detection algorithm (e.g., Canny) to identify significant gradients in the image.
   - **Hough Accumulator**: Map each edge point to a sinusoidal curve in the parameter space (\(\rho, \theta\)).
   - **Vote Counting**: Use an accumulator array to count votes in the parameter space for potential lines.
   - **Detect Peaks**: Identify the peaks in the accumulator array, corresponding to the most likely lines.

4. **Circle Detection (Hough Circle Transform)**:
   - Instead of \((\rho, \theta)\), the parameters are the center coordinates \((a, b)\) and the radius \(r\) of the circle.
   - Edge points are mapped into a three-dimensional accumulator space (one dimension for radius).

5. **Advantages**:
   - Robust to noise and partial occlusion.
   - Works well for detecting predefined geometric shapes.

6. **Limitations**:
   - Computationally expensive for complex shapes or high-resolution images.
   - Requires parameter tuning (e.g., threshold values) for optimal results.
   - Does not perform well with irregular or non-parametric shapes.

### Applications
- Road lane detection in autonomous vehicles.
- Detecting circular objects in industrial automation.
